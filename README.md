## UI Library

This project uses **Tailwind CSS** and **Flowbite** UI framework for styling and components.

### Why Tailwind CSS?

- **Utility-First**: Tailwind allows for a highly customizable and efficient way to style components. By using utility classes, you can quickly modify and adjust elements without having to write custom CSS.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind's built-in responsive utilities make it easy to create a mobile-first, responsive layout.

### Why Flowbite?

- **Pre-built Components**: Flowbite provides ready-to-use, customizable components that follow the best practices of design, making it faster to develop and maintain UI elements such as modals, buttons, cards, rating, badge, navbar and more. I have used these in this project.
- **Seamless Integration with Tailwind**: Flowbite components work smoothly with Tailwind CSS, making it a perfect choice to extend the functionality of Tailwind's utility classes.
